### Summary
The developer completed the rubric evaluation for the first instrumentation run by scoring 24 quality rules across six dimensions and documenting the results in a detailed rubric-scores file. The evaluation achieved a 79% pass rate (19 of 24 rules), with perfect scores in Code Quality, API-Only Dependency, and Non-Destructiveness dimensions, but notably lower performance in Schema Fidelity at 33% due to a domain mismatch between the Weaver registry (which defines commit-story attributes) and the instrumented code (which is Kubernetes pipeline logic from a different project).

The developer identified that two critical gate checks — compilation verification and test passage — could not be independently validated: the first because the implementation's validation chain was broken and bypassed, and the second because the modified files lacked test coverage in the evaluation repository. The evaluation documented seven important findings, including that the agent demonstrated awareness of auto-instrumentation libraries (like `@traceloop/instrumentation-langchain`) while still choosing manual span patterns, that perfect code quality coexists with upstream schema integration issues, and that the rubric's heuristic for identifying internal functions breaks down when those functions perform I/O operations.

The developer also noted practical observations: tracer naming was inconsistent across files, conditional attribute setting showed quality awareness beyond what the rubric explicitly checks, and the Schema Fidelity dimension is structurally untestable in the current evaluation setup since no amount of agent intelligence can match registry attributes describing a different domain. The full scoring breakdown and implications for future work were documented alongside raw observations and specific recommendations for refining the evaluation criteria in the next phase.
