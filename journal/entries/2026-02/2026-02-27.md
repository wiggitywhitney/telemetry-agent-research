### Summary
The developer wrote a detailed repository README documenting the complete research arc of a three-day telemetry agent evaluation project. The README covers the research question and headline findings, describes the four key outputs (spec evolution, evaluation rubric, design document, and implementation phasing), walks through each of the three PRDs chronologically, provides a detailed repository structure guide with file descriptions, includes a navigation table mapping user needs to relevant documentation, and explains how the research findings connect back to the authoritative specification. All 22 internal links were verified through the documentation workflow. With this addition, PRD #3 reached completion with all nine milestones finished.
