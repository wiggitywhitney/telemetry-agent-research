### Summary
The developer wrote a detailed repository README documenting the complete research arc of a three-day telemetry agent evaluation project. The README covers the research question and headline findings, describes the four key outputs (spec evolution, evaluation rubric, design document, and implementation phasing), walks through each of the three PRDs chronologically, provides a detailed repository structure guide with file descriptions, includes a navigation table mapping user needs to relevant documentation, and explains how the research findings connect back to the authoritative specification. All 22 internal links were verified through the documentation workflow. With this addition, PRD #3 reached completion with all nine milestones finished.

### Summary
The developer updated the prd-phase skill documentation to capture two refinements that emerged from thinking through how PRDs connect across implementation phases.

The first addition was Step 2b, a new verification step for Phase 2 and beyond. When writing a new phase's PRD, the skill now includes a step to read the previous phase's PRD—specifically the decision log and any interface changes that were made during implementation. This catches the gap between what the design document planned and what actually got built. For example, if Phase 1 added a field to InstrumentationOutput that wasn't in the original spec, Phase 2's PRD needs to know about that deviation so it can account for the actual contract, not the intended one. Phase 1 skips this step since there's no predecessor.

The second change was guidance for mapping milestones to rubric rules, but with a key nuance: only include the mapping where it's natural and real, not forced. The developer added explicit language that Phase 1 milestones about prompt engineering and file I/O don't have clean rubric connections and shouldn't be stretched to create one. Phase 2's validation chain, by contrast, maps naturally—"Tier 1 syntax check works" connects to NDS-001, "Tier 2 CDQ-001 works" connects to CDQ-001. The guidance tells future PRD writers to include the mapping where it exists; omit it where it doesn't.

Both changes were folded into the M1 milestone scope for PRD #7, since the developer was already updating the prd-phase skill in that work. The updates were small enough to do immediately while the context was fresh, rather than deferring them and losing the reasoning later.

### Development Dialogue
> **Human:** "Here are some questions that I asked Claude.ai, and the answer. Let's do this work before I close out PRD3. What do you think of everything?"
> **Assistant:** "The analysis is sound. All three points identify real gaps. Here's my take on each: **Step 2b (read previous phase PRD)** — This is the strongest suggestion. The design document defines *planned* contracts; the previous phase's decision log captures what *actually* happened. If Phase 1 adds a field to `InstrumentationOutput` during implementation, Phase 2's PRD needs to know. One targeted read of the previous phase's decision log is cheap and high-value. **Rubric mapping in milestones** — I'm more cautious here. The acceptance gate already maps to rubric rules, and that's the right level. Not every intermediate milestone maps cleanly to a rubric rule — Phase 1 milestones are about prompt engineering, LLM output parsing, and file I/O, which the rubric doesn't directly cover. Phase 2 (validation chain) maps much more naturally."

> **Human:** "Re: Rubric mapping in milestones, would it be helpful to say if it maps cleanly to a rubric rule, add a test (or whatever) - if not then don't? Or best to leave it out altogether? [...] I'm inclined to just do it since we already have the context of the conversation, tbh capturing everything in the PRD seems just as difficult as freaking writing the thing."
> **Assistant:** "On the rubric mapping: 'if it maps cleanly, add it; if not, don't' is the right framing. Make it a suggestion in the template, not a required column. Something like 'Where a milestone directly satisfies a rubric rule, note the rule ID' in the milestone guidance. That way Phase 2's milestones naturally pick up CDQ-001, NDS-003, etc., and Phase 1's milestones about prompt engineering and file I/O don't awkwardly stretch for a rubric connection that isn't there."

> **Human:** "yes, do it but 'optional rubric-rule mapping in milestone guidance' loses the nuance of our conversation"
> **Assistant:** "You're right. The nuance is: 'where a milestone directly satisfies a rubric rule, note the rule ID — don't stretch for connections that aren't there.' Let me capture that properly."

### Technical Decisions
**DECISION: Add Step 2b to prd-phase skill for reading previous phase PRD decision logs** (Implemented) - FILES: prds/7-implementation-repo-setup.md
  - Design document defines planned interfaces between phases, but implementation decisions may deviate from those plans
  - Previous phase's decision log captures actual interface changes that next phase needs to know about
  - Example: if Phase 1 adds a field to InstrumentationOutput during implementation, Phase 2's PRD must reflect the actual contract, not the planned one
  - Applies to Phase 2 onward only; Phase 1 has no predecessor
  - Lightweight extraction: read previous phase PRD specifically for decision log and interface changes, flag deviations from design document's planned contracts
  - Include deviations in new PRD's Dependencies section as "Phase N-1 delivered X (with these modifications from plan: ...)"

**DECISION: Add milestone-to-rubric mapping guidance to prd-phase skill** (Implemented) - FILES: prds/7-implementation-repo-setup.md
  - Acceptance gate already maps to rubric rules, but intermediate milestones lack explicit rubric connections
  - Not every milestone maps cleanly to a rubric rule; Phase 1 milestones about prompt engineering and file I/O have no clean rubric connection
  - Phase 2 validation chain maps naturally to rubric rules (e.g., "Tier 1 syntax check works" → NDS-001, "Tier 2 CDQ-001 works" → CDQ-001)
  - Include mapping where it's real; omit where it would be forced or artificial
  - Makes progress measurable against rubric incrementally, not just at final acceptance gate
