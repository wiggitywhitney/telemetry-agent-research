### Summary
The developer created a detailed evaluator answer key that maps all 30 code-level instrumentation rubric rules to specific sites in the commit-story-v2 codebase. This was the final piece needed to complete the rubric evaluation framework.

The mapping document inventoried 50 exported function signatures across 10 modules, cataloged 15 error handling sites with their specific behavioral patterns, and documented an expected instrumentation topology showing the full span tree from CLI entry point through git collection, chat parsing, filtering, AI generation, and journal persistence. The developer also mapped 25+ outbound call sites (git commands, filesystem operations, LLM API calls), 39 utility functions that should not be instrumented, and 27 registry attributes with their source locations in the code.

During the session, the developer made a key decision about prerequisites: the agent should check for a test suite before proceeding, but rather than blocking completely, it should issue a harsh warning requiring explicit user approval to continue without one. The developer documented this in the decision log, noting that without tests, the non-destructiveness gate (NDS-002) cannot actually verify that instrumentation preserves existing behavior—the gate passes but proves nothing. This led to a follow-up spec update for the telemetry-agent-spec requiring the test suite prerequisite check.

The developer also resolved several rubric interpretation questions that came up during mapping. They clarified that the rubric-to-codebase mapping itself is an evaluator reference, not agent input—giving the agent this answer key would invalidate the evaluation since discovering codebase structure is part of what gets evaluated. They generalized the NDS-001 compilation gate beyond TypeScript, noting that commit-story-v2 is JavaScript (ESM), so the equivalent check is `node --check` or running the test suite. They addressed the SCH-001 gap: the Weaver registry defines attributes but not operation names, so SCH-001 becomes a soft guideline evaluating naming quality rather than strict registry conformance. They also fixed the PRD context, updating it from "TypeScript/ESM" to "JavaScript (ESM) with JSDoc" to match the actual codebase.

The developer added four decision log entries documenting these choices and created a detailed spec update section noting that the telemetry-agent-spec should list a test suite as a prerequisite with harsh warnings and explicit approval required to proceed without one.

External feedback flagged several tensions in the mapping that the developer should have resolved more explicitly. The COV-006 rule on auto-instrumentation redundancy needed a clearer decision tree: if the agent registers auto-instrumentation, manual spans on the same operations are a violation; if it doesn't, the rule is N/A. The RST-004 edge case around unexported I/O functions like `saveReflection` needed dimension precedence clarified—whether the span belongs on the private helper or the public tool handler entry point. The API-004 SDK setup file exception needed a concrete example or specific filename pattern so evaluators know what to exclude from the grep. And CDQ-004 was missing from the numbering, creating confusion about whether it applies to this codebase or doesn't exist.

The mapping itself represents 83% progress on the rubric work, with rubric finalization remaining as the last milestone.

### Development Dialogue
No significant dialogue found for this development session.

The chat consists primarily of AI analysis, recommendations, and explanations rather than substantive human direction or decision-making dialogue. The developer's contributions were:

- "yes, let's start with exploring commit-story-v2" — task acceptance
- "What do we do with that rubric matching knowledge?..." — a policy question with follow-up reasoning
- "yes, log the decision and note the spec update" — task confirmation
- "let's continue with the rubric mapping" — task continuation
- Pasting external feedback from "Clock AI" — external input, not original developer speech
- "Shall I apply this update and commit?" — AI's closing question (type:"assistant")

The developer's substantive input was the policy decision about test suite prerequisites (harsh warning + explicit approval rather than hard block), but this was framed as a question to the AI rather than a declarative statement. The external feedback from Clock AI represents third-party input, not the developer's own words.

Given the absence of meaningful human quotations that would serve journalistic purposes, the retrospective summary should focus on what was accomplished—the creation of the evaluator answer key mapping and the resolution of rubric interpretation questions—without attempting to construct dialogue that doesn't substantively exist in the chat record.

### Technical Decisions
**DECISION: Clarify NDS-001 gate for JavaScript codebases** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/1-evaluation-rubric.md
  - commit-story-v2 is JavaScript (ESM), not TypeScript
  - `tsc --noEmit` does not apply to JavaScript
  - Equivalent check is `node --check` for syntax validation or running test suite for stronger validation
  - Gate should use language-neutral framing: "code compiles/parses after instrumentation"
  - If agent misidentifies language and adds `.ts` files to JS project, that is itself a gate failure
  Tradeoffs: `node --check` catches syntax errors but not module resolution; running full test suite is stronger but slower

**DECISION: Rubric-to-codebase mapping is evaluator reference, not agent input** (Discussed) - FILES: research/rubric-codebase-mapping.md
  - Mapping of rubric rules to specific commit-story-v2 code sites is an answer key for scoring agent output
  - Agent never sees this mapping
  - Discovering codebase structure is part of what the evaluation measures
  - Providing the mapping to the agent would invalidate the evaluation

**DECISION: Test suite is a prerequisite for evaluating non-destructiveness** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/1-evaluation-rubric.md
  - NDS-002 ("all pre-existing tests pass") is the only gate that catches behavioral regressions from instrumentation
  - NDS-001 catches syntax errors; NDS-003 catches accidental edits; neither catches semantic breakage
  - Without tests, NDS-002 is vacuously true but proves nothing
  - Should be a prerequisite check in telemetry agent spec with harsh warning and explicit user approval required
  - Not a hard block—real-world codebases without tests exist, but user must consciously accept the risk

**DECISION: SCH-001 scoring adjusted for missing operation registry** (Discussed) - FILES: research/rubric-codebase-mapping.md
  - Weaver registry defines attributes but not explicit span name/operation definitions
  - SCH-001 cannot be strictly evaluated as "span name matches registry definition"
  - Evaluated as soft guideline (evaluator judgment) rather than pass/fail check
  - Checks naming quality instead: bounded cardinality, consistent convention, meaningful mapping to code operations
  - Evaluator disagreement on naming quality is expected and should be documented with reasoning
  Tradeoffs: Reduces objectivity compared to codebases with fully-specified operation registry; requires evaluator judgment

**DECISION: Dimension precedence for unexported I/O functions** (Discussed) - FILES: research/rubric-codebase-mapping.md
  - `saveReflection()` and `saveContext()` are unexported (RST-004: no spans) but perform I/O that can fail (COV-002/COV-003: should have spans)
  - Resolution: span belongs on calling tool handler, not private helper
  - Tool handler is public entry point and already wraps I/O in try/catch
  - Agent instrumenting tool handler satisfies COV-002/COV-003; instrumenting private helper creates redundant spans (RST-004 + RST-003 violation)

**DECISION: COV-006 decision tree for auto-instrumentation evaluation** (Discussed) - FILES: research/rubric-codebase-mapping.md
  - Only `child_process` and `fs` have OTel auto-instrumentation packages available
  - LangChain, MCP SDK, LangGraph do not have auto-instrumentation
  - Two-step decision tree: (1) Did agent register auto-instrumentation? (2) Did it also add manual spans on same operations?
  - If no auto-instrumentation registered, COV-006 is N/A; manual spans are only instrumentation available
  - If auto-instrumentation registered AND manual spans duplicate coverage, that is a failure
  - Manual spans with domain-specific attributes (e.g., git command name, commit ref) are legitimate choice to get richer spans than generic auto-instrumentation

**DECISION: API-004 SDK setup file exception requires explicit file naming** (Discussed) - FILES: research/rubric-codebase-mapping.md
  - Agent expected to create one SDK setup/initialization file (e.g., `src/telemetry.js`, `src/tracing.js`, `src/instrumentation.js`)
  - This file imports SDK packages for configuring trace provider, exporter, etc.
  - Evaluator action clarified: grep for `@opentelemetry/sdk-*` imports; any match outside SDK setup file is a failure
  - Application modules (git-collector.js, journal-manager.js) should only import from `@opentelemetry/api`

## 2:24:32 PM CST - Commit: 1f9d40e

### Summary
The developer created a codebase-agnostic evaluation rubric for assessing AI-generated telemetry instrumentation, completing the first major milestone of the project. The new `evaluation-rubric.md` document establishes 19 instrumentation score rules adopted from the OpenTelemetry community standard and 30 code-level rules organized into six dimensions (non-destructiveness, coverage, restraint, API-only dependency, schema fidelity, and code quality), with detailed evaluation mechanisms for each rule. The rubric is designed to be portable across different target codebases and includes a gate-check structure that validates preconditions before quality scoring begins.

The developer addressed eight external review issues during finalization. These included correcting academic citation accuracy (ensuring the PMC8629732 reference matched the paper's actual content), pinning the Instrumentation Score specification to version 0.1 at commit `52c14ba`, adding a removal note for CDQ-004 (which was consolidated into other rules), clarifying SCH-001's dual-mode classification for when registries define attributes but not operation names, documenting NDS-003's filter limitation for distinguishing instrumentation-related try/finally blocks from other structural changes, and removing uncited claims about coverage percentages. The developer also marked the earlier `rubric-dimensions.md` as a working draft superseded by the finalized rubric.

The final rubric reports 28 of 30 code-level rules as fully automatable and 2 as semi-automatable (NDS-005 and SCH-004), with a note that both semi-automatable rules are candidates for LLM-assisted evaluation. The document includes detailed evaluation output formatting designed to support future use as part of an inner-loop validation stage where the rubric can guide agent iteration by feeding back specific rule failures alongside other validation signals.

### Development Dialogue
> **Human:** "The thing is that I may want to use this rubric later as part of the spec for an inner loop validation step. So I don't want it to be so merged with commit story details. One idea is to leave the current documents as is and create this additive one that is the rubric for the testing for now. What do you think?"
> **Assistant:** "That's a smart distinction. The rubric rules themselves are **spec-level** — they apply to any codebase an agent instruments. The commit-story-v2 mapping is an **instance** of applying that rubric to a specific target. [...] Better to keep the separation now."

### Technical Decisions
**DECISION: Adopt Instrumentation Score specification as foundation for telemetry evaluation** (Implemented) - FILES: research/evaluation-rubric.md
  - Community-driven, vendor-neutral standard from OllyGarden with contributions from Dash0, New Relic, Splunk, Datadog, and Grafana Labs
  - Pinned to v0.1, commit `52c14ba` (2025-11-28) to ensure stability as spec evolves
  - Separate from code-level evaluation to maintain two complementary perspectives: runtime OTLP quality vs. source code quality
  - Weighted scoring formula (Critical: 40, Important: 30, Normal: 20, Low: 10) with score ranges (90-100 Excellent, 75-89 Good, 50-74 Needs Improvement, 0-49 Poor)

**DECISION: Structure code-level evaluation as three-layer gate-and-dimension model** (Implemented) - FILES: research/evaluation-rubric.md
  - Layer 1 gates (4 rules): Binary must-pass preconditions; failure marks file/run as failed, skips quality scoring
  - Layer 2 dimension profiles (6 dimensions): Per-dimension pass rates for files/runs that pass gates; primary diagnostic output
  - Layer 3 per-file detail: Individual file dimension profiles aggregated at run level with specific failure sites
  - Impact levels (Critical, Important, Normal, Low) as prioritization hints within dimensions, not scoring weights
  - Evaluation scopes (per-run, per-file, per-instance) with per-instance rules reported as ratios at file level

**DECISION: Classify rules by automation feasibility rather than binary pass/fail thresholds** (Implemented) - FILES: research/evaluation-rubric.md
  - 28 of 30 code-level rules fully automatable via AST/diff/registry checks
  - 2 semi-automatable rules (NDS-005, SCH-004) requiring semantic judgment; candidates for LLM-assisted evaluation
  - 16 of 19 IS rules automatable at runtime, 6 automatable via static analysis
  - Guiding principle: false positives are cheap (seconds to inspect and dismiss) vs. manual review cost (hours per iteration); tilts toward aggressive automation
  - Ratios as diagnostic signal at dimension level rather than binary pass/fail thresholds

**DECISION: Keep rubric portable and codebase-agnostic** (Implemented) - FILES: research/evaluation-rubric.md
  - Evaluation-rubric.md contains only portable spec: rules, mechanisms, scoring structure
  - Commit-story-v2 specifics remain in separate rubric-codebase-mapping.md document
  - Enables future use as inner-loop validation spec without commit-story details traveling with the rubric
  - Separation allows rubric to be reused across different target codebases

**DECISION: Address external review issues on academic citations and spec stability** (Implemented) - FILES: research/evaluation-rubric.md, research/instrumentation-quality-survey.md, research/rubric-dimensions.md
  - Fixed PMC8629732 citation: changed "targets" to "observed rates" (90-100% service coverage observed across 8 surveyed systems, with gaps attributed to non-core or legacy services)
  - Removed unsupported causal claim linking instrumentation to trace quality problems
  - Pinned IS spec version to v0.1, commit `52c14ba` with date (2025-11-28)
  - Noted SPA-003 criteria marked TODO in spec (cardinality threshold not yet defined)
  - Removed uncited "90%+" claim from COV-004 mechanism; replaced with edge case description

**DECISION: Document CDQ-004 removal and clarify dimension scoring approach** (Implemented) - FILES: research/evaluation-rubric.md
  - Added removal note for CDQ-004: redundant with NDS-003 gate (both check for non-instrumentation line changes)
  - Clarified that per-instance rule ratios are diagnostic signal, not binary pass/fail thresholds at dimension level
  - Dimension profile like "Coverage: 4/6 rules passed" tells where agent is strong/weak without collapsing to binary judgment

**DECISION: Make SCH-001 dual evaluation modes explicit** (Implemented) - FILES: research/evaluation-rubric.md
  - Registry conformance mode (automatable): exact string comparison when registry defines operation names
  - Naming quality mode (semi-automatable): bounded cardinality, consistent convention, meaningful mapping when registry incomplete
  - Codebase mapping document notes which mode applies for each target

**DECISION: Document NDS-003 try/finally filtering limitation** (Implemented) - FILES: research/evaluation-rubric.md
  - Acknowledged that distinguishing "try/finally wrapping span lifecycle" (acceptable) from other try/finally changes (not acceptable) involves semantic judgment
  - Conservative filter allowing only try/finally blocks containing span.end() in finally clause reduces false negatives but may miss cases where agent restructured existing error handling
  - Same semantic judgment problem identified in NDS-005

**DECISION: Mark rubric-dimensions.md as superseded working draft** (Implemented) - FILES: research/rubric-dimensions.md
  - Added header note: "Superseded by evaluation-rubric.md, which is the finalized, codebase-agnostic evaluation framework"
  - Preserved as historical context and working draft
  - Directs readers to canonical evaluation-rubric.md

### Summary
PRD #1 was marked complete and moved to the archive. The original PRD document was deleted from the active `prds/` directory and copied to `prds/done/1-evaluation-rubric.md` with a completion date of 2026-02-24 added to the status section. PRD #3 was updated with a new decision (Decision 4) deferring the repository README to the synthesis phase, with a note that the `/write-docs` skill will be used once all research phases are complete. A corresponding decision log entry was added to PRD #3 explaining the rationale: the repo structure and findings will evolve through the remaining phases, so documenting the complete research arc after synthesis will be more accurate than writing it early.

It includes checklists for testing, documentation, security considerations, and breaking changes, along with sections for reviewer notes and follow-up work.

### Development Dialogue
No significant dialogue found for this development session

### Technical Decisions
**DECISION: Adopt industry-standard Instrumentation Score specification for runtime telemetry evaluation** (Discussed) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - Instrumentation Score is an existing vendor-neutral standard created by OllyGarden with contributions from Dash0, New Relic, Splunk, Datadog, and Grafana Labs
  - Evaluates OTLP telemetry streams against 19 boolean rules with weighted impact levels
  - No reason to reinvent scoring when industry standard already exists
  - Complements custom code-level rules that evaluate source code quality

**DECISION: Separate industry-standard evaluation from custom code-level evaluation framework** (Discussed) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - Instrumentation Score handles runtime telemetry quality; custom 30-rule framework handles source code quality
  - Two complementary perspectives reported independently
  - Good runtime output doesn't guarantee clean code; clean code doesn't guarantee good telemetry

**DECISION: Use binary pass/fail rules instead of qualitative scales for code-level evaluation** (Discussed) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - Binary rules maximize inter-rater reliability between evaluators
  - Eliminates subjective interpretation inherent in 1-5 scales
  - Degree of quality shown through aggregation ("4 of 6 rules passed") rather than abstract scores

**DECISION: Organize 30 code-level rules into three-layer structure instead of flat list** (Discussed) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - Layer 1: Gate checks (binary must-pass preconditions)
  - Layer 2: Dimension profiles (per-dimension pass rates)
  - Layer 3: Per-file detail (which files failed which rules)
  - Three layers serve different audiences: gates for pass/fail, dimension profiles for improvement guidance, per-file detail for debugging

**DECISION: Classify 28 of 30 rules as fully automatable through false-positive-cost reframing** (Discussed) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - Reframed automation question from "can a human do better?" to "what is the cost of a false positive?"
  - For agent iteration, false positives cost seconds to inspect; manual review costs hours per iteration
  - Tilts toward aggressive automation accepting imperfect precision

**DECISION: Identify NDS-005 and SCH-004 as semi-automatable candidates for LLM-as-judge evaluation** (Discussed) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - Both require semantic equivalence judgments that structural analysis cannot resolve
  - NDS-005: preserving error handling semantics across restructured code
  - SCH-004: determining semantic redundancy between attributes
  - Script narrows scope; LLM makes judgment call

**DECISION: Make evaluation rubric codebase-agnostic with separate target-specific mapping document** (Discussed) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - Rubric portable across different codebases for reuse
  - Enables inner-loop validation during agent's own fix cycle
  - Codebase-specific mapping is instance of applying rubric; same 30 rules apply to any target

**DECISION: Keep agent evaluation mapping separate from rubric to preserve evaluation validity** (Discussed) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - Agent never sees the mapping document (answer key)
  - Discovering codebase structure is part of what evaluation measures
  - Giving agent the answer key would invalidate the evaluation

**DECISION: Treat missing test suite as non-destructiveness gate that cannot be verified** (Discussed) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - NDS-002 gate passes vacuously when no tests exist
  - Hard block would prevent instrumentation of real-world codebases without tests
  - Compromise: detect no test suite, issue harsh warning, require explicit user approval, log that NDS-002 was skipped
  - User consciously accepts risk rather than tool silently proceeding

**DECISION: Design dual-purpose evaluation harness for both scoring and agent self-correction** (Discussed) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - Machine-readable output format: `{rule_id} | {pass|fail} | {file_path}:{line_number} | {actionable_message}`
  - Enables feeding specific rule failures directly into agent's fix loop
  - Agent receives same feedback format whether evaluated after-the-fact or self-correcting during instrumentation

**DECISION: Implement SCH-001 with dual evaluation modes based on registry completeness** (Discussed) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - Registry conformance mode: exact string comparison when registry defines operation names
  - Naming quality mode: checks bounded cardinality and convention when registry incomplete
  - Codebase mapping document notes which mode applies per target

**DECISION: Use impact levels as prioritization hints rather than scoring weights in code-level rules** (Discussed) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - Industry-standard Instrumentation Score uses impact levels as formula weights
  - Custom code-level rules deliberately use different approach: no formula, just gate-and-dimension profiles
  - Impact levels guide agent iteration priority ("fix this first")

**DECISION: Add PR template from claude-config to project** (Implemented) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - Provides structured PR submission guidance for future contributions
  - Includes Conventional Commits format requirements
  - Covers testing, documentation, security, and breaking change checklists

## 3:21:26 PM CST - Commit: e3928be

### Summary
The developer fixed three issues flagged in a CodeRabbit review of a pull request. The changes touched the PR template, evaluation rubric, and rubric dimensions documentation.

In the PR template, the developer consolidated and cleaned up the checklists. They merged duplicate test-related items, moved the breaking changes section into the Type of Change section so it wasn't redundant, and removed some repetitive pre-submission checklist items. The template went from feeling scattered to more streamlined.

In the evaluation rubric, the developer fixed the CDQ rule range in the automation table. Instead of listing "CDQ-001 through CDQ-007," they spelled out the individual rules since CDQ-004 was removed—listing "CDQ-001, CDQ-002, CDQ-003, CDQ-005, CDQ-006, CDQ-007" instead. This avoids the misleading impression of a continuous range when there's actually a gap.

In the rubric dimensions file, the developer corrected the Instrumentation Score Rules header from 20 to 19 and removed the redundant note explaining the counting error, since the correction itself made the explanation unnecessary.

### Development Dialogue
> **Human:** "Maybe we should change the skill so that you do the PR and start the timer, and then make the Anki cards while we wait. That would be more efficient."
> **Assistant:** "Good idea — the Anki cards don't depend on the PR, and the CodeRabbit review is dead time. Let me update the skill."

> **Human:** "Fix all three and then Push and wait for re-review."

### Technical Decisions
**DECISION: Fix CDQ rule range in automation table to reflect removal of CDQ-004** (Implemented) - FILES: research/evaluation-rubric.md
  - CDQ-004 was removed but the automation table listed "CDQ-001 through CDQ-007", which misleadingly implies 7 rules and contradicts the stated 28/30 automation count
  - Enumerated individual rules (CDQ-001, CDQ-002, CDQ-003, CDQ-005, CDQ-006, CDQ-007) to avoid misleading range notation

**DECISION: Correct Instrumentation Score Rules header count from 20 to 19** (Implemented) - FILES: research/rubric-dimensions.md
  - Section header stated "(20 rules)" but actual count is 19 (RES: 5, SPA: 5, MET: 6, LOG: 2, SDK: 1)
  - Removed redundant correction note that acknowledged the discrepancy since the header itself now reflects the correct count

**DECISION: Consolidate PR template checklists to eliminate duplication** (Implemented) - FILES: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - Testing Checklist and final Checklist contained duplicate test-related items
  - Breaking Changes section repeated information already captured in Type of Change section
  - Merged duplicate test items into single Testing section, folded breaking changes guidance into Type of Change, removed redundant pre-submission checklist items

### Summary
The API dependency documentation was clarified to distinguish between library and application use cases. The definition was updated to specify that `@opentelemetry/api` should be a `peerDependency` for libraries but a `dependency` for applications, replacing the previous statement that only mentioned it as a `peerDependency` in Node.js.

### Development Dialogue
> **Human:** "fix and push but let's merge after this regardless"

### Technical Decisions
**DECISION: Clarify API dependency type distinction between libraries and applications** (Discussed) - FILES: research/rubric-dimensions.md
  - API-Only Dependency dimension definition needed to specify `peerDependency` for libraries versus `dependency` for applications
  - Distinction reflects OpenTelemetry specification requirements for different deployment contexts
  - Update addresses consistency between working draft documentation and canonical evaluation rubric
